1. BUCKET NAMING CONVENTION
----------------------------
- All bucket names must be globally unique and lowercase.
- Use the format: [team]-[project]-[env]-[purpose]
  Example: `analytics-ml-prod-user-uploads`
- Avoid using sensitive or internal data in names.
- Do not use dots (.) if you intend to enable encryption via KMS (TLS certificate validation may break).

2. OBJECT NAMING CONVENTION-
----------------------------
- Follow a hierarchical structure using slashes to simulate folders.
  Format: [resource-type]/[YYYY]/[MM]/[DD]/[filename]
  Example: `logs/2025/05/25/app-server-01.log`
- Avoid spaces or special characters. Use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`).

3. STORAGE CLASSES (not possible to analyze with boto3)
-------------------
- Use appropriate storage classes based on access patterns:

  | Storage Class        | Use Case                           |
  |----------------------|-------------------------------------|
  | STANDARD             | Frequently accessed data            |
  | STANDARD_IA          | Infrequently accessed data          |
  | INTELLIGENT_TIERING  | Uncertain or variable access        |
  | GLACIER              | Archival, retrieval within minutes  |
  | DEEP_ARCHIVE         | Long-term storage (12h retrieval)   |

- Never store temporary or duplicate data in STANDARD.

4. LIFECYCLE POLICIES
----------------------
- Define lifecycle rules for each bucket at creation:
  - Transition to `STANDARD_IA` after 30 days.
  - Transition to `GLACIER` after 90 days.
  - Delete after 365 days (for logs, backups, etc., if applicable).

5. VERSIONING
-------------
- Enable versioning on buckets that store important or user-generated content.
- Use lifecycle rules to delete old versions after 60â€“90 days, unless required for compliance.

6. ACCESS CONTROL & PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------
- Follow least-privilege principle for IAM policies.
- Avoid using bucket-wide public access unless explicitly required.
- Block all public access at the bucket level unless there's a justified exception reviewed by security.

7. ENCRYPTION
--------------
- Always enable server-side encryption:
  - Use `AES-256` by default.
  - Use KMS for sensitive data (with dedicated keys per project if needed).

8. MONITORING & LOGGING
------------------------
- Enable S3 Server Access Logging or CloudTrail to track access to critical buckets.
- Use S3 Storage Lens for usage metrics and insights.

9. DUPLICATE DETECTION
------------------------
- Periodically run a hash-based scan across buckets to identify duplicate objects.
- Prefer deduplication or object referencing where possible.

10. CLEANUP & COST MANAGEMENT
------------------------------
- Audit unused buckets and objects monthly.
- Tag all buckets with:
  - `owner`, `environment`, `data-classification`, `retention-policy`
- Use cost explorer and S3 analytics to review access patterns.
