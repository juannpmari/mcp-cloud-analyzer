SECTION C: LAMBDA FUNCTIONS
----------------------------

1. NAMING CONVENTION
   - Format: [team]_[project]_[env]_[purpose]
     Example: `etl_user_events_dev_processor`
   - Keep function names under 64 characters for compatibility.

2. MEMORY & TIMEOUTS
   - Start with minimal memory (128 MB) and tune based on metrics.
   - Set timeouts as short as possible — default to 15 seconds unless otherwise justified.

3. DEPLOYMENT & VERSIONS
   - Use Lambda **aliases** for staging, blue/green, and production routing.
   - Keep only the last 5 versions unless regulatory requirements say otherwise.
   - Package dependencies in layers if reused across functions.

4. LOGGING & MONITORING
   - Always log to CloudWatch; use structured logging (JSON).
   - Set up log retention: max 30 days for dev/test, 90+ for prod.
   - Use AWS X-Ray for tracing high-traffic or slow functions.

5. TRIGGERS
   - Use EventBridge over CloudWatch Events for new projects.
   - Avoid using Lambda for high-throughput Kinesis or DynamoDB streams unless necessary (consider MSK or Firehose).
   - Use batching & error handling configurations.

6. SECURITY
   - Use least-privilege IAM roles.
   - Never hard-code credentials or secrets — use SSM Parameter Store or Secrets Manager.
   - If accessing VPC resources, ensure subnet + security group setup allows DNS and internet access if required.

SECTION D: GENERAL TAGGING STANDARD (ALL SERVICES)
----------------------------------------------------
- All resources must have the following tags:
  - `Project`: Name of the project
  - `Environment`: dev / test / staging / prod
  - `Owner`: Team or individual responsible
  - `CostCenter`: Internal billing code
  - `AutoDelete`: yes/no (for automated cleanup)
  - `Compliance`: if special data handling rules apply
