AWS RESOURCES MANAGEMENT GUIDELINES
====================================

SECTION B: DYNAMODB
--------------------

1. NAMING CONVENTION
   - Format: [team]_[project]_[env]_[table-name]
     Example: `analytics_realtime_prod_events`
   - Avoid using dashes (`-`) in table names — use underscores (`_`).

2. PARTITION & SORT KEYS
   - Choose keys carefully based on query access patterns.
   - Avoid hot partitions by distributing keys evenly.

3. CAPACITY MODE
   - Use **on-demand** for unpredictable workloads.
   - Use **provisioned** for steady-state usage — configure auto-scaling.

4. INDEXING
   - Create secondary indexes only when necessary.
   - Monitor index usage and delete unused indexes regularly.

5. TTL & ARCHIVAL
   - Enable TTL for automatic expiry of stale records.
   - Move cold data to S3 using DynamoDB Streams + Lambda pipelines.

6. SECURITY & BACKUP
   - Enable point-in-time recovery.
   - Restrict IAM access to least privilege.
   - Encrypt all tables with KMS (default key is OK unless otherwise required).

---

SECTION D: GENERAL TAGGING STANDARD (ALL SERVICES)
----------------------------------------------------
- All resources must have the following tags:
  - `Project`: Name of the project
  - `Environment`: dev / test / staging / prod
  - `Owner`: Team or individual responsible
  - `CostCenter`: Internal billing code
  - `AutoDelete`: yes/no (for automated cleanup)
  - `Compliance`: if special data handling rules apply
