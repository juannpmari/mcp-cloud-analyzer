SECTION A: EC2 INSTANCES
-------------------------

1. NAMING CONVENTION
   - Format: [team]-[project]-[env]-[role]-[index]
     Example: `data-warehouse-prod-worker-01`
   - Tag all instances with:
     - Name
     - Owner
     - Project
     - Environment
     - AutoShutdown (yes/no)

2. INSTANCE TYPES
   - Choose instance types based on workload:
     - `t3` / `t4g` for general purpose, dev, or test
     - `m5` / `c6` for compute-intensive
     - `r5` for memory-heavy applications
   - Prefer ARM-based Graviton instances where compatible for cost/performance.

3. SECURITY
   - Use key pairs managed via AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.
   - Only allow SSH via bastion hosts or SSM Session Manager.
   - Block all inbound access by default â€” open ports only as needed.
   - Enable automatic patching with Systems Manager.

4. COST & AUTO-SCALING
   - Use Auto Scaling Groups for stateless applications.
   - Enable Spot Instances for non-critical or fault-tolerant workloads.
   - Use instance schedules (e.g., shut down dev servers after-hours).

5. MONITORING & BACKUP
   - Use CloudWatch to track CPU, memory, disk.
   - Enable detailed monitoring if required.
   - Set up regular AMI and volume backups via AWS Backup or Lambda.

SECTION D: GENERAL TAGGING STANDARD (ALL SERVICES)
----------------------------------------------------
- All resources must have the following tags:
  - `Project`: Name of the project
  - `Environment`: dev / test / staging / prod
  - `Owner`: Team or individual responsible
  - `CostCenter`: Internal billing code
  - `AutoDelete`: yes/no (for automated cleanup)
  - `Compliance`: if special data handling rules apply
